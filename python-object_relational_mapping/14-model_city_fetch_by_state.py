"""
14-model_city_fetch_by_state
that lists all City objects
from the database hbtn_0e_14_usa
and is ordered by cities.id (ascending)
The script should take 3 arguments: mysql
username, mysql password and database name
It uses SQLAlchemy to connect to the MySQL
database and fetches City objects along with their
associated State objects. It prints each city
with its state name in the format:
"<state name>: (<city id>) <city name>"
If there are no cities, it will not print anything.
